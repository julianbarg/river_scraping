Known limitations/issues
- Image scraping aborted when there are videos within photo galleries
- In the current version, caps the number of images that are scraped per post to 10 and the number of
  comments that are scraped to 25. This is not a hard limit, and can be set to "None".
- Does not copy full links from comments
- Comments not separated from comment author
- Does not record likes
- Not scraping visitor posts to pages (groups do not allow for visitor posts)
